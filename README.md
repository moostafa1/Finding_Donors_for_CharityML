# Finding_Donors_for_CharityML
# Classification using supervised learning in ML



# Project Overview

CharityML is a fake charity at siliconvalley that has a noble goal, which is collect donations
to let the charity being able to learn students interested in ML for free!



### Running the program

Anaconda's jupyter notebook

### Program Details

<<<<<<< HEAD
It uses supervised learning on a dataset to predict the possible donors for the charity
according to many factors as: age, workclass, education, education num, marital status, etc....
This is done using a classification model, and this model must be the best one for predicting according
to this dataset, so by trying lots of supervised learning classifiers we got our best model to solve this

problem by least error and short period of time.
the most factor that's  token in consideration while choosing our model is:

*	f_score of the model.
*	time taken to train our model.
*	time taken to predict new instances.

These calculations are so helpful to determine the best model for this problem.
